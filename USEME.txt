INTERACTIVE MODE:
SUPPORTED COMMANDS:
 - File menu: new, load (image/project), save (image/project)
              New: completely resets the editor.
              Load: Two modes
                  Image: Loads an image as a new layer (be sure it's the same size as the layers below)
                  Project: Removes what's currently in the editor and loads a complete project from a selected directory
              Save:
                  Image: Saves the top-most visible image to the specified file name
                  Project: Saves the entire project to the specified directory
 - Edit menu: blur, sharpen, sepia, grayscale, mosaic, resize
              All of these apply the specified effect to the top most visible image, with the exception of resize, which is
              applied to all images in the project. Mosaic and resize will prompt for the number of seeds and the
              width + height, respectively. It is possible to cancel these operations by just x-ing out of the argument prompts.
 - Layer menu: generate checkerboard, remove, show, hide, visibility
               Generate: Adds a new layer with a generated checkerboard image, with height, width, 2 colors, and square size specified
                         by the user.
               Remove: Removes the specified layer
               Show: Sets the specified layer to visible
               Hide: Sets the specified layer to invisible
               Visibility: Hover over this menu to see which layers in the project are visible, indicated by a check next to their labels

TEXT MODE:
SUPPORTED COMMANDS:
help {displays list of possible commands}
import ['project', 'image'] [path] {imports an image to the top layer or imports an entire previously saved project}
  ex. import image example.png
export ['project', 'image'] [path] {exports an the topmost image or the entire project to the specified path}
  ex. export project directory\whereTheProjectWillGo
  NOTE: export will not overwrite a project that is already saved at the specified path, so if you wish to
        overwrite an existing project, you must delete the project folder.
hide [layer #] {makes the specified layer invisible}
  ex. hide 0
show [layer #] {makes the specified layer visible}
  ex. show 1
edit [blur, sharpen, monochrome, sepia] {modifies the top layer with the specified edit subcommand}
  ex. edit blur
generate [height] [width] [r1] [g1] [b1] [r2] [g2] [b2] [squaresize] {generates a checkerboard image}
  ex. generate 200 200 40 60 80 60 80 100 20
q {quits}

NOTE: either an import or a generate command must be run to load an image before export, hide, show, or edit are run.
